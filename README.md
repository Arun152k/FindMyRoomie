# FindMyRoomie
<p align = "justify">
'FindMyRoomie' is a Web Application that provides a platform for lonely wolves (NC State students) to find roommates of their preference. The stakes are high when it comes to finding your best roommate because this relationship starts with a living relationship :sweat_smile:. We understand how stressful this can be, especially if you are moving to a new city or country. FindMyRoomie is a one-stop solution to your roommate finding needs. Our software has functionalities that allow you to filter and choose your ideal roommate. But if that is too much work for you, we also provide roommate suggestions based on your preferences! Any NC State student could sign up with their NC State Email address from any corner of the world on our website and begin searching for roommates.

## Steps to set up the project on your local machine

#### 1. Clone the repository:  

   `git clone https://github.com/rohitgeddam/FindMyRoomie.git`

#### 2. Setup the virtual environment:  
    
    `python -m venv venv`

#### 3. Activate the virtual environment:  

    * On Mac/Linux:    
    
      `source venv/bin/activate`
      
    * On Windows:    
    
      `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
#### 3. Install required modules and libraries:  

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 4. Create .env file at ./src/config/
```SECRET_KEY=
DEBUG=
EMAIL_BACKEND=
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_USE_TLS=
EMAIL_PORT=
EMAIL_HOST_USER=
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
```
Fill the above field and save.

#### 5. Run the application:  
   
   ```
   cd src 
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
  
## After adding another field to Model
Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Populate fake data for testing

```
python manage.py seed_users <number of fake instances>

# creates ten fake users
python manage.py seed_users 10
```

## Automatic tools - GitHub Actions
 
We use GitHub actions to automate tasks of linting, code coverage, build, tests, and security checks. The codes that perform these actions are stored as `.yml` files in the `.github/workflows` directory. The GitHub actions are triggered whenever something is pushed (or pulled) into the remote repository. The results of these automated tasks are shown as badges at the top of this README.md file. 

### Unit tests:


### How to build docs
`sphinx-build -b html docs/  docs/build `

## Automatic tools - GitHub Actions

### Code Coverage: 

Code Coverage is an important metric that allows us to understand how much of the codebase is tested. `Code_Cov.yml` performs this task. For more information about Code Coverage, please visit this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage). 

### Flake8 - Code Linting:

We are using Flake8 for linting and syntax checking, and it is performed by `Linting.yml`. For more information about Flake8, please visit this [link](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/what-is-flake8-and-why-we-should-use-it-b89bd78073f2).
Use flake8 before you push code to GitHub. </br>
Config file present in `setup.cfg`.

```
flake8 <directory>
```

### Black - Code Formatter

We are using the Black code formatter to format our code before pushing it to GitHub. For more information about Black, please visit this [link](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Run the line below everytime you push to GitHub.</br>
Config file present in `pyproject.toml`
```
black --line-length 120 <filename>
```

If you prefer using Black in VSCode, you can add the below settings in your vscode settings:

```
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "120"],
    "python.linting.enabled": true
}
```
  
### Pre Commit Hooks for Black Code formatting and Flake8 Linting
* run  `pre-commit install`
* Now everytime you commit, Black and Flake8 will run automatically and will not allow you to push if the code standards are not met.

### CodeQL

`CodeQL.yml` performs automated security checks on the codebase and scans it for any vulnerabilities and bugs. For more information about CodeQL, please visit this [link](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/). 
  
## Privacy Notice

#### 1. What personal details of yours would you be sharing with us and why?

You are free to include anything in your bio (which could include your Instagram ID and other social media handles). 

#### 2. Will we be storing your details, and how will we use them?

## Technology Used
-   `Python 3.7+`
-   `Django 4.1.2`
-   `HTML5`
-   `CSS3`
-   `BootStrap v5.2`

## Future work:
1. Include the optional Apartment details in the profile section. The details could include (but are not restricted to) the address of the apartment, the apartment BHK and size, and rent. Users who have already secured a property and are looking for roommates to occupy them could use this functionality.
2. Provide an update for the 'My Room' page, giving users the option to include and display their finalized roommates.
3. Create a platform within the website that allows homeowners to lease or sublease their apartments.
4. Implement a Chat room that allows users to chat with one another. 
5. Create a mobile application.
6. Implement a subleasing option.
