# FindMyRoomie

FindMyRoomie is a Web Application that provides a platform for NC State students to find roommates of their preference. The stakes are high when it comes to finding your best roommate because this relationship starts with a living relationship :sweat_smile:  We understand how stressful this can be. FindMyRoomie is a one-stop solution to your roommate finding needs. Our software has functionalities that allow you to filter and choose your ideal roommate. But if that is too much work for you, we also provide roommate suggestions based on your preferences! Any NC State student could sign up with their NC State Email ID from any corner of the world on our website and begin searching for roommates.

  A page with a happy Mr. and Mrs. Wolf enjoying each other's company in the background, just like you and your roommates would be :heart_on_fire: 

4. My Profile: 

Allows you to introduce whom you are to your future roommate! You are given the opportunity to tell others a little bit about yourself and your preferences. The "Visibility" checkbox in your profile allows you to choose whether you want to be visible to others. If you are looking for roommates, you can toggle it on, and if you have found one (Congratulations :partying_face: :partying_face:), you can toggle it off. It's that easy!

 5. Find people:
 Lists the people looking for roommates just like you. Our "Wolf Filter" lets you filter candidates based on your preferences :wolf:	

 6. My room:
 Lists your roommates (feature not available yet) and provides roommate suggestions based on your preferences. The similarity scores with other roommate seekers are calculated based on the Manhattan Distance, and the people with the top scores are shown as suggestions.

2. In the IDE terminal, copy and paste the command: 

   `git clone https://github.com/rohitgeddam/CSC510_PROJECT1.git`

3. To setup the virtual environment

   `python -m venv venv`

    * On Mac/Linux
    
      `source venv/bin/activate`
    * On Windows
    
      `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
   (If you get an error at this step, continue on.)
   
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   If you get an error, do `pip install django`.

4. To run the virtual environment

   Type into the terminal:
   
   ```
   cd src 
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   
Click the link next to "Starting development server at " to view the project.

## How to create a new webpage

Read the instructions starting from "Here we create the varied pages and assign the respective HTML files" on this webpage: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/django-creating-a-multi-page-website/

## After adding another field to Model
Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

   ```
   py manage.py makemigrations
   py manage.py migrate
   ```

## Populate fake data for testing

```
python manage.py seed_users <number of fake instances>

# creates ten fake users
python manage.py seed_users 10
```

## Automatic tools - GitHub Actions

### Unit tests:

### Code Coverage: 

### Flake8 - Code Linting:

We are using Flake8 for linting and syntax checking.
Use flake8 before you push code to GitHub.
config file present in `setup.cfg`

```
flake8 <directory>
```

### Black - Code Formatter

We are using the Black code formatter to format our code before pushing it to GitHub.
Run the line below everytime you push to GitHub.
config file present in `pyproject.toml`
```
black --line-length 120 <filename>
```

If you prefer using Black in VSCode, you can add the below settings in your vscode settings:

```
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "120"],
    "python.linting.enabled": true
}
```
### Pre Commit Hooks for Black Code formatting and Flake8 Linting
* run  `pre-commit install`
* Now everytime you commit, Black and Flake8 will run automatically and will not allow you to push if the code standards are not met.
